# DOTFILES as HECK

Welcome, and enjoy your stay.

## tl;dr

If you wanna take this baby for a spin:

- Please backup your current configuration files (wherever they might live).
- Clone this repo into your config directory.
- Be safe and have fun.

## HI-TECH

Yeah it is.

I'm currently running the following programs:

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/index.html)
- [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)
- [starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [Nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom)
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Why tho?

It is a good and cool thing to share your configurations with others.

More than anything, I hop between devices often and like pulling this
ball and chain along with me.

Friends are welcome to use, enjoy, and extend. Enemies are welcome to
high cholesterol and hopefully a terrible day (you know who you are).

## License?

Do people even do that for dotfiles? Whatever.

Water damage will void your warranty, everything else is up to you.
