# DOTFILES as HECK

Welcome, and enjoy your stay.

## tl;dr

If you wanna take this baby for a spin:

- Please backup your current configuration files (wherever they might live).
- Clone this repo into your config directory.
- Keep your arms and legs inside the compartment at all times.
- Be safe and have fun.

## HI-TECH

Yeah it is.

I'm currently running the following programs:

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/index.html) - My terminal emulator of choice.
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) - Better language runtime version management.
- [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) - Soft colours for soft critters.
- [starship](https://starship.rs/) - Because maintaining your own prompt is ridiculous.
- [Nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - Table stakes in the year 20XX.
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - As friendly as it is interactive.
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) - Hear me out on this: it's good actually.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - Vimscript where?
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - Can't top bottom these days.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - I am legitimately afraid of these animals.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Find all things fuzzy.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - All find, no fuzz.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - `rg`.
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) - Plays well with `bat`.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - If you made it this far, touch grass.

## Why tho?

It is a good and cool thing to share your configurations with others.

More than anything, I hop between devices often and like pulling this
ball and chain along with me.

Friends are welcome to use, enjoy, and extend. Enemies are welcome to
high cholesterol and hopefully a terrible day ([you know who you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSY0aspgKo)).

## License?

Do people even do that for dotfiles? Whatever.

Water damage will void your warranty, everything else is up to you.
